# Google-Feb-2017 (HASHCODE)
Hash Code is a team-based programming competition organized by Google for students and industry professionals across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. You pick your team and programming language, we pick a real-life engineering problem for you to solve. Are you up for the challenge? 

February  was the month of google. We saw this event in our university and we wanted to try solve the problem.

We ended up with this two different approachs, one builded in java while the second one, which is my favourite one, builded in python.
